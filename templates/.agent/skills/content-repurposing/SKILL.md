| Hashtags/Tags? | Platform SEO |

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Same caption everywhere | Customize for each platform |
| Wrong image ratio | Check specs before posting |
| No context | Content should standalone |
| Too much at once | Space out publishing |
| No tracking | Use UTMs, track performance |

|------------------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| Blog: [Title] | Thread ✅ Carousel ✅ Video ⏳ | 70% | 500 views |
| Video: [Title] | Clips ✅ Blog ❌ | 50% | 1k views |

> **Remember:** Repurposing isn't just copying. Each format should feel native to its platform while delivering the same core value.
