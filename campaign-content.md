## 💼 LinkedIn Post

```
I built a toolkit for marketers who use AI.

Here's why:

Every marketer I know uses ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini.
But we all start from scratch. Every. Single. Time.

"Write a blog post about..."
"Create ad copy for..."
"Analyze my competitors..."

Repetitive. Inefficient. Frustrating.

So I packaged 24 marketing skills into one kit:

📝 Content marketing & copywriting
🎯 Lead generation & growth hacking  
📊 SEO & analytics
🔎 Competitor intelligence
🎨 Ad creative generation

Plus 4 ready-to-use workflows:
• /campaign - Build campaigns A to Z
• /content - Create any content type
• /analyze - Performance analysis
• /optimize - CRO improvements

It's free. Open source. One command to install.

If you're a marketer using AI → this is for you.
